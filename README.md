# Climate Science Resources

A living, evidence-based repository of climate science resources for introductory university courses.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a central, trusted hub for students, embodying the principles of scientific consensus, evidence-based reasoning, and the self-correcting nature of science. All resources are curated for their scientific rigor and alignment with the consensus of climate scientists.

Our goal is to move beyond static documents and create a dynamic system where information can be proposed, vetted, and integrated with clear rationale—a model of collaborative, transparent knowledge building.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse** the resources organized by topic or type.
2. **Suggest** new resources by opening a GitHub Issue (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).
3. **Contribute** by submitting a Pull Request that adds or improves resources.
