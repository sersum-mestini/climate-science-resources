# Contributing to Climate Science Resources

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this collaborative repository! The goal is to maintain a high-quality, evidence-based collection of climate science resources. All contributions are welcome, provided they align with the scientific consensus and are supported by peer-reviewed literature.

## How to Propose a New Resource

We use a transparent, two-step workflow: **Issue → Pull Request**.

### Step 1: Open an Issue
Before adding a resource, please open a GitHub Issue to propose it. This allows for discussion and vetting by the community.

**Issue Title Format:** `Resource Proposal: [Resource Name]`

**Issue Body Template:**

```markdown
**Resource Link:** [URL to the resource]

**Rationale for Inclusion:**
Explain why this resource is valuable for students. Emphasize its scientific rigor, alignment with climate science consensus, and pedagogical value.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
List 3–5 key climate science concepts that students will learn from this resource.

**Suggested Placement:**
Propose where in the repository this resource should be linked (e.g., "Under 'Foundational Documents' in README.md" or in a new section).

**Additional Notes (optional):**
Any other relevant information, such as prerequisites, accessibility considerations, or related resources.
```

### Step 2: Submit a Pull Request
Once the Issue has been discussed and there is agreement that the resource is appropriate, you (or another contributor) may submit a Pull Request that adds the resource to the repository.

**Branching:**
- Create a new branch from `main` (e.g., `add-resource-name`).
- Make your changes (edit `README.md`, create a new markdown file in a `resources/` folder, etc.).
- Commit with a descriptive message referencing the issue (e.g., `Add IPCC SPM resource. Closes #1`).

**Pull Request Description:**
- Clearly describe what the PR does.
- Link to the original issue by typing `Closes #X` (where `X` is the issue number).
- If the PR implements a change suggested during the Issue discussion, note that as well.

## Review Process

All Pull Requests will be reviewed by at least one maintainer (or a designated reviewer) before merging. The review will focus on:
- **Scientific accuracy** – does the resource reflect the current scientific consensus?
- **Clarity and accessibility** – is the resource understandable for an introductory‑level student?
- **Proper attribution** – is the source correctly cited?
- **Formatting and organization** – does the change fit the repository’s structure?

Reviewers may request changes, ask for clarification, or approve the PR. Once approved, the PR will be merged (typically using a squash merge to keep history clean).

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to uphold a respectful, inclusive, and evidence‑based dialogue. Personal attacks, misinformation, and pseudoscientific claims are not permitted.

## Questions?

If you are unsure whether a resource is suitable, feel free to open an Issue with your question. We are happy to help!
